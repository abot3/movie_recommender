Live App: https://abot3.shinyapps.io/movierecommender/

This is code for a shiny app for a movie recommender based on collaborative filtering.

This app requires your movied images to be placed in the `MovieRecommender/MovieImages/` directory.
Your working directory should be set to the parent directory of `MovieRecommender`, and run using
`run_app.R`

The dataset used is the MovieLens Dataset contaning user ratings of a corpus of movies.
